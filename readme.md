# Github Trending

This project is a tutorial for developers who want to learn basic knowledge about web scraping.
The goal is to scrape data from GitHub and rank the repositories based on the repositories you stared.

The knowledge required is just a basic understanding of coding.

This tutorial will assume you don't know anything about Golang or HTML.
If you already know them, you can skip some parts of the tutorial.

## Goal

Before we do a project, we'd better ask why we want to do it and how to measure the result, those are like our compass to prevent us from getting lost.

### To Answer the Why

Github has its trending of repositories, but they are mainly based on the stars of everyone, but you are not everyone.
So it would be nice to create a trending based ourselves to help us to find more high-quality projects that fit your needs.
